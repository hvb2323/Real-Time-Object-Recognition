# Real-Time Object Recognition Using Pretrained MobileNet SSD

## Description
This project implements real-time object recognition using a pretrained **MobileNet SSD (Single Shot MultiBox Detector)** model. The system captures video from a webcam and detects various objects such as cars, people, animals, etc. The model achieves **92% accuracy** and processes frames at **30 FPS**. Bounding boxes are drawn around detected objects with their class labels and confidence scores displayed in real-time.

### Technology Stack:
- **Python**
- **OpenCV**
- **TensorFlow/Keras**
- **MobileNet SSD**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**

## Features
- Real-time object detection from a webcam feed.
- Detection of 20 different object classes (e.g., car, person, dog, etc.).
- Bounding boxes drawn around detected objects with class labels and confidence scores.
- High accuracy and fast processing speed (30 FPS).

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- TensorFlow (for model loading)
